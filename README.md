Windows' default RGB values are:  
Hilight: 0 120 215  
HotTrackingColor: 0 102 204  

You can make your own "Hilight" color by changing the hue,  
then subtract 18 from the second value and 11 from the third to make the "HotTrackingColor" value.  

Right click on one of the downloaded files > Edit in Notepad > change the values with yours then save and run the file.
